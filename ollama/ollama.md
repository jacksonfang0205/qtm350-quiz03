Q1: what are human?
A: Humans have a deep sense of connection, empathy to those around them (psychology), curiosity about the world they 
interact with and learn from it themselves over time through experience education as well learning by doing. They 
also value relationships in life - even when we're talking algorithms or AI which may not appreciate human 
interactions directly but understand their purpose better due to shared experiences, goals etc., that could be seen 
within these systems too (as humans are naturally flexible and adaptive).
Q2: how do you think english novels?
As an AI focused on general knowledge and not trained to analyze literature or other forms of human language like 
English小说，I don't have personal opinions. However, I can provide information related primarily about the topic in 
question such as literary theory (like genre classification) based solely off textual data from reliable sources 
including books published by authors who specialize in a certain field and those written specifically for that 
purpose.
